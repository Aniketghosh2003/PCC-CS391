# PCC-CS391
This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code required for the PCC-CS391 course at Makuat University. It serves as a comprehensive resource for students to understand and implement various algorithms and data structures covered in the course curriculum. It is created by me.

# Contents:

1.Implementation of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
2.Algorithms covering sorting, searching, tree traversal, graph traversal, and more.
3. Examples demonstrating the application of DSA concepts in problem-solving.
# Usage:
Students can utilize this repository to study, practice, and reinforce their understanding of DSA topics covered in PCC-CS391. They can clone or download the repository and explore the code examples provided.

# Contribution:
Contributions from students and instructors to enhance the repository with additional examples, optimizations, or corrections are welcomed through pull requests.
